# Introduction

### Cronos Chain

Crypto.org introduces the Cronos mainnet beta, the Cosmos SDK based EVM compatible chain, on 8 Nov 2021.

Cronos is the EVM compatible chain running in parallel to the [Crypto.org Chain](https://crypto.org/docs/). It aims to massively scale the Chain DeFi ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to rapidly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, with the access to the massive user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and the funding from Cronos Ecosystem Grants. 

#### Cronos on Ethermint

Cronos is powered by [Ethermint](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint), which allows rapid porting of apps & smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Cronos base settlement currency will be CRO, the native currency of the Crypto.org Chain.
The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol enables interoperability and bridging to the Crypto.org Chain: a fully decentralised, open-source, energy efficient public chain with high speed and extremely low fees. It also allows interoperating with other IBC-enabled chains (e.g., Cosmos Hub).

#### Cronos Ecosystem Grants 
Cronos Ecosystem Grants program aims to support early-stage projects on Cronos by bootstrapping initial product development and providing technical support. We aim to align incentives together with new builders and teams by helping their projects grow together with the broader ecosystem. We welcome any talented individuals & teams who are passionate and committed to building incredible products within the Cronos ecosystem. Interested parties can visit [Cronos grant page](https://cronos.org/grants) and [Cronos Medium page](https://medium.com/cronos-chain) to learn more about this grant program and its latest update.


### Features

**EVM Compatible** - Ethereum developers are used to smart contract capabilities as Ethermint can support any smart contracts, DAOs or Dapps deployed on Ethereum.

**Scalable** - Tendermint can process way more transactions per minute than the EVM, making it faster, cheaper and greener to execute smart contracts.

**Interoperable** - IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other; interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

**Easy deployment** - Users can follow the deployment instruction to quickly and easily deploy Cronos network for their own using purposes.

**Crypto.com ecosystem** - 50 million users + ecosystem

**Crypto.com community Support** - Crypto.com community support - contribution to open-source projects, security reviews.
