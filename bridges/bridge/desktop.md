**Step 2**: Select “From” Crypto.org Chain as the origination chain and “To” Cronos Chain as the destination chain

Only the `Crypto.org Chain <=> Cronos` route will be available on Day 1. The `Ethereum <=> Cronos` route will not be available till the Cronos Gravity Bridge goes live. As a user of the Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet, you will automatically have a Crypto.org Chain wallet address and Cronos Chain wallet address created for you. These wallet addresses will automatically be detected by the Cronos bridge.

**Step 3**: Enter the amount of CRO you want to transfer and click “Transfer Asset”

You will be able to verify the amount that you will receive and your Cronos address after entering the amount of CRO that you want to transfer. Click “Transfer Asset” and enter your Password to proceed.

**Step 5**: Await for Bridge confirmation

After the transfer is initiated, the CRO will be bridged from the Crypto.org Chain to the Cronos Chain. The bridging process typically takes about a few minutes to complete. Once it’s done, you will see an updated balance in your receiving Cronos address.

Additionally, you will be able to view the Transaction in further details by clicking the transaction hash which directs you to the Crypto.org Chain explorer.And you can always review your latest bridge transfer history by clicking the icon at the top-right corner.
